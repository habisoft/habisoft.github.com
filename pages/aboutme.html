      <div style="text-align: left;">
        <div style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <big><big>At

              an early age, being one of the fortunate children to
              experience the <a
                href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nintendo_entertainment_system">nintendo

                entertainment system (NES)</a>, my life was forever
              changed. At that moment in time</big></big>,<big><big> my
              fascination in everything digital was born.&nbsp; </big></big><big><big>As
my
infatuation
of
video
games
grew,

              I found myself on a quest for knowledge and understanding
              of the computer machines upon which these games would run.
              By the mid-90's, when my family adopted internet, I
              immediately became immersed in the vast amount of
              knowledge everyday people were able to have at their
              fingertips, especially knowledge of computers. </big></big><big><big><br>
              <br>
              &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Throughout all except one of my years
              in grade school, I partook in music classes and being a
              member of the school choir, although video gaming remained
              my primary passion.</big></big><big><big> I would spend
              the free time of my summer breaks learning computer
              trouble shooting and elementary programming skills.</big></big><big><big>
              By my freshman year of high school my computer skills were
              beyond proficient, and I was able to code in BASIC. </big></big><big><big>By
              the time I had written a few toy programs in BASIC, I felt
              brave enough to veture into the world of <a
                href="http://www.gnu.org/">GNU Linux</a> and <a
                href="http://www.freebsd.org/">BSD UNIX</a>, and the <a
                href="http://gcc.gnu.org/">GCC</a>. </big></big><big><big>And

              by my junior year of high school I enrolled in an advanced
              placement computer science course on C++ programming. <br>
              <br>
              &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; By the end of my high school career, it
              became obvious that I would have to go to university in
              order to expand my knowledge of computers and acquire a
              theoretical foundation to allow me to further pursue
              computing as a career. I began my formal education in
              computer science during the fall 2002 semester. During the
              final year of my undergraduate studies, I began working as
              a research assistant in order to facilitate the transition
              to becoming a graduate student. And by fall 2007, I
              started graduate school. In the summer of 2009, I defended
              my master's thesis on a technique for extracting the left
              and right vocal folds (chords) from High-Speed videos by
              employing <a
href="http://books.google.com/books/about/Segmentation_of_Laryngeal_High_Speed_Vid.html?id=-JMi40kmSt4C">
                a pair of elastic membrane structures, that harness
                dynamic programming to perform global optimization of an
                energy functional to bypass local minima, resulting in
                extraction of the vocal folds</a>. </big></big><br>
